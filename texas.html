                <h3>University of Texas at Arlington</h3>
                <p>My time at UT Arlington has been nothing short of transformative. 
                    Although studying at UTA was a curveball, I wouldn't have asked for 
                    a better experience. To keep it short, the whole experience reshaped my
                    understanding of the field of computer science. The vastness and complexity
                    of the field--encompassing artificial intelligence, data science, system designs
                    and more areas i had baredly scratched the surface of before. Engaging in thought-provoking
                    projects has allowed me to delve into these domains, expanding both my technical expertise
                    and intellectual curiosity. Moreover, my time at UTA has introduced me to brilliant minds, 
                    peers and professors alike, whose passion and ingenuity inspire me to go beyond my expectations. 
                    This realization has motivated me to explore the full potential with an open mind and relentless
                    curiosity. </p>
